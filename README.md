This repository contains a simple COBOL program demonstrating a potential data truncation bug and its solution.  The program involves moving data between two fields with a fixed length. If the source data exceeds the target field's size, truncation can lead to unexpected results and errors. The solution involves verifying data lengths before moving to prevent truncation and improve data integrity.
